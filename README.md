Filename: Flower.py
Description: This file is the code used to represent Object Oritentated Programming (OOP) in Python. I have used a pre-existing class named "Flower" and gave it objects that are actions that the flower does, such as "bloom" or "grow". The two flowers found in the file are made already, called "Rose" and "Daisy". I have made another flower in the program called "Cornflower" and used the attributes "bloom" and "grow". The output will say that all three flowers will grow and bloom.
