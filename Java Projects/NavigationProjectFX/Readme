In this project, this functions similarly the same to the original navigation project but in JavaFX. The new stuff is that you can add locations, remove locations, and save your location list. In the first iteration of this navigation project, I had used an ArrayList to store all of the locations. It is commented out of the program because the program now uses file reading and writing to store locations and create new locations. The vehicle class is basically the same except it now throws an error at the user if the user doesn't have enough gas or there is no gas station at their current location.
