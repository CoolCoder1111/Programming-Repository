This project uses a list of game genres in an enumerator class, file reading, and JavaFX. I was prompted with a text file that had all of the games on it, the genres of the games, and the number of players (min, max). I used that file with the Enumerator class to create a game search where you can search for a game and the program will show you a list based off of the critera you give it.
