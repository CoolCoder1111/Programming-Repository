In this project, I created a little navigation game. The programs prompts the user with what they want their miles per gallon for your car to be. Then it asks what the max fuel cap of the car should be. After that, the program prompts you with three option: to drive to a location, refuel at the current location, or quit the game. There are two classes included in the project, a vehicle and a location class. The vehicle can drive, refuel, check its current fuel and has a toString method where it displays where it is on an X and Y coordinate and display its current fuel. The location class has a getting for its location name, a getX amd getY method that returns X or Y, and checks to see if the location has a gasstation. If the location doesn't have a gas station, then nothing will happen. If the vehicle doesn't have enough fuel to make the trip to the destinated selected, it will simply print out "no".
