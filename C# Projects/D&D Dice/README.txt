This project asks the user how many dice should the "Diceroll" method roll. It then takes the user input and stores it. Next, the program asks how many sides should the amount of dice have and takes the user's input from that question. The Dice roll method takes two parameters that are the numbers from the user in the main method. It then creates a random number and simulates an actual dice roll with the for loop. Once its done calculating the numbers, it then goes back into the main method to plug in the result and shows it to the user.
