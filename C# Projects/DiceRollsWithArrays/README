This project is asks the user how many times they would like to throw two, 6-sided dice. I used an array to act as a tally for 12 random values to a single integer. The first for loop simulates two die throws and adds them up to add to the tally. The second for loop displays the random numbers and calculates the average of the throws by adding and multiplying all the values up and then dividing the result by the user input. That value is then stored into the average and is shown to the user.
